102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal 
Total Accepted: 98420 Total Submissions: 302881 Difficulty: Easy
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]

思路：采用广度优先遍历，即使用队列来辅助遍历二叉树，同时添加NULL标记作为每层结束的标志
