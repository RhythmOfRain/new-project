public:
    int getSum(int a, int b) {
        int sum = 0, i = 0, canary = 0;
        while(i < 32){
            int lhs = (a >> i) & 1;
            int rhs = (b >> i) & 1;
            sum |= (lhs ^ rhs ^ canary) << i;
            if((lhs & rhs)|| ((lhs | rhs) & canary)) canary = 1;
            else canary = 0;
            ++i;
        }
        return sum;
    }
