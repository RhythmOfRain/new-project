Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

my solution:
对32位中每一位上的1进行计算，结果要么是3N要么是3N+1，如果是3N+1，则证明结果对应位上是1
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int res = 0, len = nums.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; ++i){
            int temp = 0;
            for(int j = 0; j < len; ++j){
                temp += ((nums[j] >> i) & 1);
            }
            res |= (temp %= 3) << i;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
